#What is PyTprch?
->It is a Deep Learning Library Developed by Meta Ai.
-> Using this Library we are able to make a very strong Nural Network Application.

#Invention of PyTorch:-
-> Pehle jab Torch Library this vo sab tensor base operations ke liye bohat acchi and popular thi but usko use karne ke liye hame "lua" language sikhni padti thi kyu ki vo lua me hi work karti thi lein Meta ke sab developer Python jante the so "Meta AI" ne ee folt pakda and puri "Torch" library ko python me bana diya and Name De Diya "Python + Torch" = "PyTorch".
-> This is the Hostory of the PyTorch Library.


#PyTorch 1.0(2018)
    *Key Fetures:-
    -> Python COmpatibility:- The Pytorch is Competable with the other librarys. Ham Pytorch ko dusri librarys ke sath bhi easyly use kar sakte hain.

    *Dynamic Computation Graphs:- 
    -> Before this version into the PyTorch ther have a Static Computation graph of the Training model.
    -> After the Train a Model PyTorch is make a Computation Graph(or make a graph of the mathamatical ewquestion that was created at the training part.)but its make a Static Graph not Dynamic.

    -> Computatoin Graph:->  PyTorch is make a graph of the Mathamatical operations this graph is known as Computaino Graph.
        Ex.:-  (a) (b) --->(a+b)---->  (c) => (a+b)+c  
    -> Our Nural network is basicaly a Mathamatical Operations.
    -> Using this Dynamic Computation Graph we are able to change the Computation graph at the RunTime.
    -> Key Fetures:-
        Debuging Easy
        Flexibility

    
    # Key Fetures:
    (1) Tensor Computation
    -> Tensor Computation it menas Multidimentional Array, it will be 1D,2D,3D...etc.
    -> It Helps to represent the different types of data into the Tensor Computations.
    -> PyTorch is Convert any data into the tensor data(Its Convert data into Multi Dimentional Arrays). 
    -> Like Audio.Video,Image,Text into the Tensor Computation(or Multidimentional Arrays)

    (2) GPU Acceleration
    -> This Tensor Computation is work in the CPU.
    -> We are able to perform the Tensor Computatios into the GPU also, and its give the best and fast speed to do the Tensor Computaions. 

    (3) Dynamic Computation Graph
    -> Whenever we are make any Nural Network then the PyTorch is make a One graph of this Full Nural Network that is known as Computation Graph.
    -> After creating this graph if we are change anything into our nural network so this PyTorch is change the Graph accordingly the Updates so this is known as a Dynamic Computations.
    ->
    (4) Automatic Differentiation
    ->

    (5) Distributed Training 
    -> Whenever we are work into the big dataset and we need a multiple systems of multiple CPUs for performing this Nural Network that time we are able to work with the Multiple CPU so this Pytorch is also give this fetures.

    (6) Interoperebility With Other Librarys.
    -> This Pytorch is esely communicate with other librarys.
